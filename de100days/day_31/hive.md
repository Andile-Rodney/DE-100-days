# Hive intro

## General Idea

## Use case 

- Data Warehousing
- Ad-hoc Analysis
- ETL 

## Hive main component

- Hive Clients 
- Hive Services 
	- Metastore:
		- You can think metastore as a central repository for storing all the Hive metadata information.
		- Hive metadata includes various types of information like structure of tables and the partitions along with the column, column type, serializer and deserializer which is required for Read/Write operation on the data present in HDFS. 
		- The metastore comprises of two fundamental units:
			- A service that provides metastore access to other Hive services.
			- Disk storage for the metadata which is separate from HDFS storage
	
- Processing framework and Resource Management
- Distributed Storage


## Hive Data Model

- Table
	- Managed Table 
		- Hive is responsible for managing the data of a managed table. So, the data belonging to the dropped managed_table no longer exist anywhere in HDFS and you canâ€™t retrieve it by any means. 
		(Basically, you are moving the data when you issue the LOAD command from the HDFS file location to the Hive warehouse directory)

	- External Table

- Partition

- Bucket
