## Design concept / Basic pattern

### Concept 
- Whenever we are designing a large system, we need to consider a few things:
	- What are the different architectural pieces that can be used?
	- How do these pieces work with each other?
	- How can we best utilize these pieces: what are the right tradeoffs?

### Key characteristics 
- Scalability
- Reliability
	- reliability is the probability a system will fail in a given period.
- Availability
	- availability is the time a system remains operational to perform its required function in a specific period
- Efficiency
	- response time
	- throughput (or bandwidth) 
- Manageability
	- Serviceability or manageability is the simplicity and speed with which a system can be repaired or maintained
