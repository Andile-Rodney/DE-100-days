## Design concept / Basic pattern

### Concept 
- Whenever we are designing a large system, we need to consider a few things:
	- What are the different architectural pieces that can be used?
	- How do these pieces work with each other?
	- How can we best utilize these pieces: what are the right tradeoffs?
